The Sitecore CDP Exam can be difficult to prep for without having adequate data representation, especially if you're a visual learner. After failing the CDP exam my first time around I realized that even though the documentation was plenty, there was still a lack of visual substance that can only really be achieved by Lab work or hands-on experience.

Through my second round of studying, I took to practice by creating a fairly simply Next.js application that simulates CDP data ingestion so that I could achieve a better understanding of the data in the system and how it flowed through real-time data ingestion to segmentation to audience outflows.

Introducing [The CDP Data Playground App](https://github.com/bewards/nextjs-cdp), an app that can be ran locally (or deployed to Vercel/Netlify, just make sure to keep your client key and token secure) to expedite sample data flow! The App only requires that a CDP sandbox is already set up. Follow the README and start sending data to your CDP!

## CDP Playground Notes
🐻 Engage SDK managed using [Zustand State Management](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) <br/>
Ⓜ️ Thoughtfully crafted using Tailwind &amp; Mantine UI

✨ Current Feature List
- Current User Tracking via Engage SDK
    - VIEW event configured at Layout with Zustand Provider
    - IDENTITY event via Simple Form (FormCoupon)
- Simulating Events via Stream API Direct HTTPS Requests
    - Simulating 10 new guests with page view
- Add to cart for ADD event configured

## Exam Take 2 Key Understandings
Along side the application, it was also imperative to have key understandings of the 5 competencies. I've listed areas below from these competencies that aided in passing the second time around:

### Competency 1: Customer Data Platform
- PII Data and Identity Model 2.1
- Data extensions, their attributes, conventions, and limitations
- Event Sessions and hierarchy
- Data Lake file access and format

### Competency 2: Real-Time Behavioral Data Ingestion
- Stream API
	- General characteristics
	- Engage SDK integration points and when to use each one
	- Direct HTTPS Request requirements
	- Debugging initialization and events
- Event types
- Order for checkout sequence

### Competency 3: Interactive (REST) API
- Resources that use the API
- Required API parameters and request attributes
- API Status codes & authorization types

### Competency 4: Batch Data Ingestion
- Limitations on size and resource collections (Guest and Offline orders)
- Steps to uploading
- JSON record requirements

### Competency 5: Batch Segments and Audience Export
- Accessing exports
- Data output via Dynamic attributes and Javascript
